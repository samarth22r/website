                <h4><span>SCADA HACKING</span></h4>
                <p>The project presented a comprehensive exploration of SCADA system vulnerabilities, simulated attacks,
                    and potential threats. It outlined a risk reduction methodology, emphasizing elapsed time for
                    successful attacks. The outcomes included detailed documentation of vulnerabilities,
                    proof-of-concept exploits, and actionable insights for enhancing SCADA security. The project's
                    real-world applicability extends to informing policy decisions and shaping industry best practices.
                    It identified limitations such as cybersecurity risks, interoperability challenges, and human
                    factors. Future enhancements aim to refine the compromise graph model and develop a user-friendly
                    tool for risk analysis and secure system design, contributing to a more resilient SCADA
                    infrastructure.</p>

                    occurrences that seem suspicious because they're different from the established pattern of
                    behaviors. Anomaly detection isn't new, but as data increases manual tracking is impractical. I have
                    reviewed 20 research paper done on anomaly detection using different techniques and problem

                <p>This study analysed the current blockchain research trends in healthcare. The blockchain technology
                    presents a decentralized network and is regarded as having great potential for use in healthcare,
                    because of the sensitive nature of data being processed and managed. The purpose of the study was to
                    determine the present status of blockchain research and implementation in healthcare. To achieve
                    this objective, we have defined research questions and using the predefined methodology we have
                    narrowed down the analyzed literature to 15 publications. These were then further analyzed. mainly
                    between 2014 and 2021.</p>
